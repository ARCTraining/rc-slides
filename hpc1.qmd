## Introductions and Motivations

Who are you and why are you here?

Hackpad!

## Question

What problems are you encountering with your computational work now? 

Why / how do you think HPC will help?

## Key Concepts

- High Performance Computing (HPC)
- High Throughput Computing (HTC)
- "Supercomputing"

## Applications

![](assets/img/hpc1/spectrum.png)

## Leeds facilities

- ARC3 brought into service in 2017
- ARC4 brought into service in 2019

## A Supercomputer isn’t...

## Single computer vs grid of computers

![](assets/img/hpc1/hpc-diagram.png)

## Serial and parallel programs

- Serial programs run on a single CPU core, solving one problem at a time.
- Paralel programs run across multiple CPU cores, splitting the workload between them and solving the problem faster.

## Serial Program

## Parallel Program

## Basic parallel machine

![](assets/img/hpc1/basic-parallel.png)

## Terminology

- **Node**: the physical machine/server. In current systems, a node would typically include one or more processors, as well as memory and other hardware.

- **Processor**: the central processing unit (CPU) inside the node, which contains one or more  cores.

- **Core**: Refers to the basic computation unit of the CPU. This is unit that carries out the actual computations.

## Differences from Desktop computing?

- We don’t log on to compute nodes directly
  - submit jobs via a batch scheduling system
- Not a GUI-based environment
- System is shared with many other users
- Resources more tightly monitored and controlled
  - Memory
  - CPU usage (‘cores’)
  - Time

## Benefits of using HPC

- Speed
- Volume
- Cost
- Efficiency
- Convenience

## Parallel Paradigms

From a systems perspective:

- Shared memory parallelism
- Distributed memory parallelism

Unless you are writing your own codes, the software developer takes care of this.

## HPC at Leeds

ARC4 is latest incarnation of central HPC at Leeds.

HPC currently comprised of two facilities called ARC3 and ARC4

All Faculties are shareholders and so it is important that all who can benefit
from the use of this facility do so.

## ARC3 {.smaller}

2 x login nodes: 24 cores and 128GB RAM

252 x standard compute nodes: 24 cores and 128GB RAM (=6048 cores); 100GB SSD

4 x High Memory (24 core and 768GB nodes)

6 x P100 GPU nodes (24 core, 128GB and 4 x NVidia P100)

2 x K80 GPU nodes (24 core, 128GB and 2 x NVidia K80)

2 x Intel Xeon Phi (Knights Landing) vector processor nodes

836TB of high speed storage: /nobackup

## ARC4 {.smaller}

2 x login nodes: 40 cores and 192GB RAM

149 x standard compute nodes: 40 cores and 192GB RAM (=6048 cores); 100GB SSD

4 x High Memory (40 core and 768GB nodes)

3 x V100 GPU nodes (40 core, 192GB and 4 x NVidia V100)

1.2PB of high speed storage: /nobackup

## Drives and Directories

HPC users have access to two storage areas:

- A HOME directory
- Space on /nobackup

## Home Directory

This is:

- Private to you
- Backed up
- Limited to 10GB storage (ARC)
- Shared between machines

## /nobackup

- Each HPC cluster has it’s own high speed storage service called /nobackup
- You need to make your own directory (using mkdir)
- Nothing is backed up
- Files will expire after 90 days not being used
- Need to set permissions to make files private (ARC3) but not on ARC4.

## Transferring files and data

- scp or rsync command line utility
- wget (to download from a remote server)
- git (version control)
- smbclient to copy from local M:/ and N:/ drives on campus
- Google Drive and OneDrive (via rclone)
- graphical programs like Cyberduck or Filezilla
