## Course objectives

This course should help you to:

- Become familiar with best practice with regards to scientific data visualisation
- Build a toolkit of resources to help you create objective, informative plots
- Use Python and Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create aesthetically pleasing graphics
- Be aware of some common issues when it comes to data visualisation

### What is Python

- A flexible, human-readable programming language with simple "syntax"
- It is commonly used for:
    - data analytics
    - scientific programming 
    - visualisation
- It has a huge collection of specialised libraries to solve specific research problems
- It is Open Source

### What is Data Visualisation

- A way of graphically representing data
- Can include plots, graphs, charts, schematics, maps, infographics
- Commonly found in research papers, publications, policy documents, on conference posters, in talks, on news reports...

## Rule 1: Know Your Audience

Who will be reading it, in what context?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
- You
- Your supervisor(s)
- General scientific or research audience
- Experts in your field
- Experts in a specific method you use
- The general public
- Policy makers
- Undergraduate students
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

## Rule 2: Identify Your Message

## Rule 3: Adapt the Figure to the Support Medium

## Rule 4: Captions Are Not Optional

## Rule 5: Do Not Trust the Defaults

## Rule 6: Use Colour Effectively

## Rule 7: Do Not Mislead the Reader

## Rule 8: Avoid “Chartjunk”

## Rule 9: Message Outshines Beauty

## Rule 10: Get the Right Tool(s)
