### What is Python

- A flexible, human-readable programming language with simple "syntax"
- It is commonly used for:
    - data analytics
    - scientific programming 
    - visualisation
- It has a huge collection of specialised libraries to solve specific research problems
- It is Open Source

### What is Data Visualisation

- A way of graphically representing data
- Can include plots, graphs, charts, schematics, maps, infographics
- Commonly found in research papers, publications, policy documents, on conference posters, in talks, on news reports...
