## Introduction to Linux

Aims of this training:

- Introduce you to using command line interface (CLI) Linux
- Build your confidence in navigating Linux file systems using the command line
- Enable you to use Linux without a graphical user interface (GUI)
- Prepare you for [HPC1: Introduction to High Performance Computing](https://arc.leeds.ac.uk/training/courses/hpc1/)

::: {.notes}
- This is a brief, introductory level session. 
- Do not assume knowledge of file systems/directory structures/other computing background.

## Format of this course

This is a **2 hour tutorial**. The first half will involve lecture slides with some background information, while the second half will use some coding.

These lecture slides are based on the [Software Carpentries documentation on Unix Shell basics](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).

Once you finish this tutorial, we recommend you read through the extended notes available.

## Syllabus

- Introduction to the command line and common terminology

## Interacting with a computer {.smaller}

When we use a computer, we interact with the hardware through an **operating system** or **OS**.

Common operating systems for research computers include:

- Microsoft Windows
- MacOS
- Linux

We are going to be looking at Linux today, which is a family of operating systems that are **Open Source** and are widely used in research, for example on **High Performance Computing** platforms like ARC4 or Aire.

## Interacting with a computer {.smaller}

When we use a computer, like our desktop or laptop, we often use a **Graphical User Interface** or a **GUI**.

- GUIs allow us to interact with a computer through graphical means: icons, text, buttons, windows. GUIs usually involve using a mouse and clicking into menus.
- The Windows desktop and MacOS desktop are GUIs that let you control the computer graphically.
- Many computer programs also have GUIs: for example, Excel.

## Interacting with a computer {.smaller}

As well as using a GUI, we can also interact with computers using a **Command Line Interface** or a **CLI**.

- CLIs allow us to interact with a computer through text-based commands typed into the command-line.
- While GUIs can be simple and intuitive to use, they can make it difficult to reproduce workflows:
  - Sometimes you have to record by hand (or with a screen recording) what sub-options from different menus you used;
  - Updates to GUIs can make it difficult to find the same menu options;
  - A workflow with multiple steps can be tedious to repeat for multiple datasets (having to click through multiple layers of menu options for each dataset).
- Many large research machines (such as the HPC machines ARC4 and Aire here at Leeds) *do not have a GUI* and so you need to interact with them through a **CLI**.

## Command Line Interfaces {.smaller}

- There are multiple different CLIs available:
  - General-purpose CLIs are available for each **Operating System** for general computer control:
    - Windows Command Prompt;
    - Windows Powershell;
    - Mac Terminal;
  - Some specific programs have their own custom CLIs:
    - Anaconda Prompt for Windows;
    - Git Bash for Windows;
- Today, we are going to be using a **Unix Shell**:
  - This is the general-purpose CLI that underpins both Linux and Mac;
  - We will use Bash, a popular Unix Shell.

## Poll

Throughout this presentation, we will be using quick polls to gauge your familiarity with concepts.

Let's test it out:

## Bash

How do we access Bash?

- Bash is the default shell on Unix systems like Linux or Mac
- Bash is also available through many command-line tools for Windows:
  - Git Bash for Windows
  - Anaconda Prompt

We're going to use a **virtual machine** for this course: this is a Linux machine running in the cloud.
