- Prepare a poll.
  - This can be done using `Forms` within `Teams`
    - Forms can be prepared in advance, but it is probably easy enough to create them when wanted...
    - In the `Teams Chat`, select:
      - ... (the three dots)
      - ...More Apps
    - Search for "Forms" and select.
    - Complete details.
  - Another way is to conduct an "emoji poll":
    - This involves making a post that asks participants to respond with an emoji reaction.
      - E.g. Thumb up for one answer, heart for another.
    - It is probably easiest to copy and paste a previous emoji poll than create one from scratch.
    - In June 2023, The Teams chat could not parse text pasted in to replace codes with emojis, but this feature may get added and that should make this easier...
