## Mermaid {.smaller}
- [https://mermaid.js.org/](https://mermaid.js.org/)
- Mermaid is evolving as a way of developing diagrams using makdown
- It was originally geared for producing flow diagrams
- There are some useful examples on the website and online
- The plan is to replace diagrams produced other ways with diagrams produced with markdown as this becomes easy


## Outline
- This set of slides provides some examples that might be useful templates to adapt for training presentation slides


## Training Portfolio {.smaller}
Some of the boxes are hyperlinks.

## Euler diagrams
- Euler diagrams are not yet supported in Mermaid, but this feature might be coming:
