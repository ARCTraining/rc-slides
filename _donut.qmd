## Presentation set up guide
- If using Teams share the Web browser window containing the slides ('`Slide View`').
- Activate '`Speaker View`':
  - From the `slide-menu-button` (bars in the lower left), select:
    - `Tools` (at the top) >> `Speaker View` (from the list).
  - This should open the '`Speaker View`'.
    - Locate and read the `Notes` (lower right).
- If in a classroom, there should be a way to project a different view to what you can see on the lecturn display facing you.

::: {.notes}
- The current slide in `Slide View` and `Speaker View` should synchronise:
  - So moving on to the next slide should do the same in both windows/tabs.
- `Speaker View` shows a preview of the next slide in the right upper pane above these notes.
- Presentations delivered using Teams.
- Move on to the title slide:
   - Use the down or right keyboard cursor keys or activate the `controls-arrow` that looks like `>` in the lower right of the slide.
