## Presentation set up guide
- If using Teams share the Web browser window containing the slides ('`Slide View`').
- Activate '`Speaker View`':
  - From the `slide-menu-button` (bars in the lower left), select:
    - `Tools` (at the top) >> `Speaker View` (from the list).
  - This should open the '`Speaker View`'.
    - Locate and read the `Notes` (lower right).

::: {.notes}
- The current slide in `Slide View` and `Speaker View` should synchronise.
  - There should be a view of what slide is next in the right upper pane in the `Speaker View`.
- This has been tested for presentations delivered using Teams.
- Whether there can be both a `Slide View` and `Speaker View` for presentations delivered in a classroom where often the entire screen is shared to the display is uncertain...
  Decide how to proceed, then move through to the title slide to complete the set up.
  - Use the down or right arrow keys or activate the `controls-arrow`.
