## Basic Structure Suggestion {.smaller}

```{.bash}
# The most basic structure for a code project should look like:
my-model
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
├── src                <- Source code for this project
└── tests              <- Test code for this project
```

::: {.panel-tabset}

<!-- These were for python - so not necessary for more broad talk
### Source Code


### Test

- All tests units (files and methods) must be named starting with `test_` and placed inside a package (or subpackage) called `tests`.
- Tests can be grouped in just one folder for the entire repository or they can be organized within each package/subpackage.
-->

### Readme

- Is a guide that gives users a detailed description of a project you have worked on
- It is the first file a person will see when they encounter your project, so it should be fairly brief but detailed.
- See how to write a good README file in this [`freecodecamp` post](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file/).

### Requirements

- Text information about all the necessary additional libraries, modules, and packages.
- This can be replaced by files like: [`environment.yml`](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file), [`pyproject.toml`](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/#creating-pyproject-toml), [`setup.py`](https://www.pythonforthelab.com/blog/how-create-setup-file-your-project/).
