Same applies when comparing users in same Faculty.\nThe lower the usage, the higher the priority (and vice versa).\n“Backfilling” is used to fit smaller jobs in between the top priority jobs. All jobs have specified run time, and so the scheduler will run lower priority jobs if they will start and finish before the highest priority jobs are scheduled to start. Thus indicating a realistic runtime for a job, will make short jobs eligible to be backfilled, potentially shortening their wait-time."
